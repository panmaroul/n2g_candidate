To execute the application just run Publisher.php and Consumer.php simultaneously. I uploaded the database with some data that was stored during the execution of the application.
In future improvents i would create an automatic script to run publisher and consumer script in parallel. Moreover, i would use the Symfony framework. There were some issues during the creation of the application in Symfony and that is the reason that i used pure PHP. Given more time i would have completed it in Symfony Framework.
